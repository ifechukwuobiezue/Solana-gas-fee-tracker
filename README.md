# Solana Gas Tracker

This project tracks Solana gas prices and uses a webhook implemented in **Express.js** to recieve transaction data received from the QuickNode stream. The backend is exposed through **ngrok**, and the frontend is built with **React**.

## What is QuickNode Streams/Functions?
[QuickNode Streams](https://www.quicknode.com/streams) provides real-time, low-latency blockchain data access via WebSockets, allowing developers to subscribe to specific events and receive updates without repetitive polling.

[QuickNode Functions](https://www.quicknode.com/functions) offer serverless, on-demand code execution for tasks like smart contract interactions and custom business logic, streamlining development and reducing resource usage.

As mentioned in my [tweet](https://x.com/CeedoTech/status/1873493972435468467): <blockquote> Yes, I know Solana gas fees are relatively low, but as traders, we always want to maximize profit. ðŸ’¸
This project will not only keep you updated on gas fees and transactions but also show you how to utilize QuickNode to create such tools for your preferred blockchain! ðŸ”— </blockquote>

So here is a Live Demo: https://solana-gas-fee-tracker-gasoline.vercel.app/ to view the app, but to setup the app locally follow this step:

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (which comes bundled with npm) - [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **ngrok** - [ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/) (for exposing the local backend to the internet)
- **QuickNode** - [Quicknode account](https://www.quicknode.com/) (for accessing the Solana transaction stream and creating an API key)

## Installation

Follow the steps below to get the project up and running.

### 1. Clone the repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/solana-gas-tracker.git
cd solana-gas-tracker
```


### 2. Install Backend Dependencies

Navigate to the backend directory:

```bash
cd backend
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up the Backend
The backend is powered by Express.js and receives webhooks from webhook. 
So go to [QuickNode Streams Dashboard](https://dashboard.quicknode.com/streams/) and create stream, the stream destination will be your express webhook route.

In this project, I created a stream on the Solana Mainnet , applied for dataset as blocks, and applied the stream filter code found in the root directory of this repository.


Start the Express server, using Native file watch:

```bash
node --watch server.js
```

In another terminal, start ngrok to expose the backend server:

```bash
ngrok http 3000
```
Assuming your backend is running on port 3000.
This will generate a public URL (e.g., http://xyz.ngrok.io/webhook). Use this URL as your stream destination.

#### 4. Install Frontend Dependencies
Navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd ../gasoline
```

Install the React app dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 5. Run the Frontend

Start the React development server:

```bash
npm start
```
This will open the React app in your browser (since your backend is running on 3000, it will startup at http://localhost:3001).

### 6. Access the App
Frontend: Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3001 to view the React app.
Backend: Your backend should be running locally on http://localhost:3000 and will be exposed via ngrok for webhook testing.

### 7. Test Webhook Integration
Ensure that the webhook functionality is working by sending data from Quicknode to the ngrok URL you generated earlier (e.g., http://xyz.ngrok.io). Your backend will receive and process the data at the `/transaction` route, and the frontend will update accordingly.
